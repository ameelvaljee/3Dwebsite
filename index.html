        <h2>👩🏽‍🚀 Who Am I?</h2>

        <p> Think of me as being in a constant state of superposition, existing in multiple potentials and possibilities at once. Like a quantum system, I embrace different aspects of myself—student and teacher, thinker and doer, gym bro and couch potato, artist and scientist. I’m not defined by a single label or state, but by the vast spectrum of who I can be, depending on how I’m observed.</p>
